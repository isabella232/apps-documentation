# Lessonly Apps Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Lessonly Apps.

Lessonly Apps are a way to build something that enhances a companies Lessonly experience.

[Lessonly Apps](apps.md) provide a consistent way for installing an app on a company and redirecting the user to that app for configuration. Start here for info on creating your first app.

[Signals](signals.md) gives apps a way to listen in on happenings in the core app so that they can respond to them.

**API access** This is still a work in progress, but eventually apps should be able to access the API of the core app to ask for information using app specific authorization tokens.
